The plan for the conintuation of this project.

Finish the analytical solving function

add the method of brute force in sudoku_solver which when it gets stuck analytically will try a number and see if the sudoku works out

translate the code into javascript

use droidscript to make an android app that can scan in pictures of sudokus using the camera and then solve them and display a picture of the solved sudoku on the screen.
